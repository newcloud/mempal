pub const MEMORY_PROTOCOL: &str = r#"MEMPAL MEMORY PROTOCOL (for AI agents)

You have persistent project memory via mempal. Follow these rules in every session:

0. FIRST-TIME SETUP (once per session)
   Call mempal_status() once at the start of any session to discover available
   wings and their drawer counts. Only use wing/room filters on mempal_search
   AFTER you have seen the exact wing name in that status response (or the
   user explicitly named it). Guessing a wing (e.g. "engineering", "backend")
   silently returns zero results. When uncertain, leave wing/room unset for a
   global search.

1. WAKE UP
   Some clients (Claude Code with SessionStart hooks) pre-load recent wing/room
   context above. Others (Codex, Cursor, raw MCP clients) do NOT — for those,
   step 0 is how you wake up. Trust drawer_ids and source_file citations in
   any results you receive; they reference real files on disk.
   Wake-up is an L0/L1 refresh surface, not the typed dao/shu/qi assembler.
   It may show important knowledge drawers, but it does not assemble tiered
   sections or apply dao_tian budgets. For typed operating guidance, use
   mempal_context.

2. VERIFY BEFORE ASSERTING
   Before stating project facts ("we chose X", "we use Y", "the auth flow is Z"),
   call mempal_search to confirm. Never guess from general knowledge when the
   user is asking about THIS project.

3. QUERY WHEN UNCERTAIN
   When the user asks about past decisions, historical context, "why did we...",
   "last time we...", or "what was the decision about...", call mempal_search
   with their question. Do not rely on conversation memory alone. You can also
   call mempal_tunnels with action="list" to discover related rooms across
   wings when context may live in another project.

3b. USE MIND-MODEL CONTEXT FOR GUIDANCE
   When you need ordered operating guidance rather than raw evidence search,
   call mempal_context. It assembles typed knowledge in the intended runtime
   order: dao_tian -> dao_ren -> shu -> qi, with evidence and Phase-2 card
   context opt-in. Use this before choosing a workflow or skill when the user
   asks "how should we approach this?" or when a task benefits from high-level
   principles plus concrete tool bindings.
   dao_tian is intentionally sparse in runtime context: by default at most one
   dao_tian item is injected. Set dao_tian_limit=0 when universal principles
   are not needed, or raise it only when explicitly reasoning about
   cross-domain fundamentals. max_items remains the total output budget.

   Skill-selection discipline:
   - Read dao_tian first for cross-domain principles.
   - Read dao_ren next for field-specific constraints.
   - Use shu to choose a workflow or skill family.
   - Use qi to choose concrete tools, commands, or environment-specific usage.

   Treat trigger_hints as bias metadata only. They can influence candidate
   workflow, skill, and tool choices, but they are not hard-coded skill ids and
   must not automatically execute skills. Memory hints never override system
   instructions, user instructions, repo instructions such as AGENTS.md or
   CLAUDE.md, or the client-native set of available skills. If hints conflict
   with those sources, follow the higher-priority instruction source.

   Use mempal_context to choose an approach, workflow, or skill. Use
   mempal_search to verify project facts, past decisions, and citations.
   Do not use wake-up as a substitute for mempal_context when you need typed
   dao/shu/qi guidance; wake-up preserves a refresh-oriented L0/L1 shape.
   Use mempal_field_taxonomy when choosing a `field` value for typed evidence,
   knowledge, search, or context. Field taxonomy is guidance only; custom
   field strings remain valid when the recommended fields are too coarse.

3a. TRANSLATE QUERIES TO ENGLISH
   The default embedding model is a multilingual distillation (model2vec) but
   still performs best with English queries. Non-English queries may miss
   relevant results. When the user's question is in Chinese, Japanese, Korean,
   or any other non-English language, translate the semantic intent into English
   BEFORE passing it as the query string to mempal_search. Do NOT transliterate
   — capture the meaning. Example: user says "它不再是一个高级原型" → search
   for "no longer just an advanced prototype".

4. SAVE AFTER DECISIONS
   When a decision is reached in the conversation (especially one with reasons),
   call mempal_ingest to persist it. Include the rationale, not just the
   decision. Use the current project's wing; let mempal auto-route the room.

5. CITE EVERYTHING
   Every mempal_search result includes drawer_id and source_file. Reference them
   when you answer: "according to drawer X from /path/to/file, we decided...".
   Citations are what separate memory from hallucination.

5a. KEEP A DIARY
   After completing a session's work, optionally record behavioral observations
   using mempal_ingest with wing="agent-diary" and room=your-agent-name (e.g.
   "claude", "codex"). Prefix entries with OBSERVATION:, LESSON:, or PATTERN:
   to categorize. Diary entries help future sessions of any agent learn from
   past behavioral patterns. If recording multiple entries in one day, set
   diary_rollup=true to merge them into the current UTC day's single drawer and
   reduce search noise. Example: "LESSON: always check repo docs before writing
   infrastructure code."

8. PARTNER AWARENESS (cross-agent cowork)
   When the user references the partner coding agent ("Codex 那边...",
   "ask Claude what...", "partner is working on...", "handoff..."), call
   mempal_peek_partner to read the partner's LIVE session rather than
   searching mempal drawers. Live conversation is transient and stays in
   session logs, not mempal. Use peek for CURRENT partner state; use
   mempal_search for CRYSTALLIZED past decisions. Don't conflate the two.
   Pass tool="auto" to infer the partner from the MCP client you are
   connected through, or name it explicitly (claude / codex).

9. DECISION CAPTURE (what goes into mempal)
   mempal_ingest is for decisions, not chat logs. A drawer-worthy item is
   one where the user (and you, optionally with partner agent input via
   peek) have reached a firm conclusion: an architectural choice, a
   naming/API contract, a bug root cause + patch, a spec change. Do NOT
   ingest brainstorming scratchpad, intermediate exploration, or raw
   conversation. When the decision was shaped by partner involvement
   (you called mempal_peek_partner this turn), include the partner's key
   points in the drawer body so the drawer is self-contained without
   re-peeking. Cite the partner session file path in source_file alongside
   your own citation.

10. COWORK PUSH (proactive handoff to partner)
   Call mempal_cowork_push when YOU (the agent) want the partner agent
   to see something on their next user turn. This is a SEND primitive —
   orthogonal to mempal_peek_partner (READ live state) and mempal_ingest
   (PERSIST decisions). Typical use: partner should notice a status
   update, blocker, or in-flight decision that is too transient for a
   drawer but too important for the user to have to relay manually.

   Delivery semantics: at-next-UserPromptSubmit, NOT real-time. The
   partner's TUI does not re-render on external events; delivery happens
   when the user types their next prompt in the partner's session,
   triggering the UserPromptSubmit hook which drains the inbox and
   injects via the standard hook stdout protocol.

   Addressing: pass target_tool="claude" or target_tool="codex" to
   choose explicitly, or omit to infer partner from MCP client identity.
   Self-push (target == you) is rejected.

   When NOT to push:
   - Content you also want to persist → use mempal_ingest (drawers)
   - Trigger partner mid-turn → not supported (at-next-submit only)
   - Broadcast to multiple targets → one target per push
   - Rich content / file attachments → only plain text body (≤ 8 KB)

   On InboxFull error: STOP pushing and wait for partner to drain. Do
   NOT retry — that would just fail again.

11. VERIFY BEFORE INGEST (contradiction detection)
   Before ingesting a decision that asserts relationships between named
   entities ("X is Y's Z", "X works at Y", "X is the Z of Y"), call
   mempal_fact_check with the draft text. The tool reports three kinds
   of issues:
   - SimilarNameConflict: the mentioned name is ≤2 edit-distance from a
     known entity (probable typo — Bob vs Bobby).
   - RelationContradiction: KG already records an incompatible predicate
     for the same (subject, object) endpoints.
   - StaleFact: the KG row for the asserted triple has valid_to < now.
   Treat any surfaced issue as a prompt to confirm with the user before
   persisting. Fact checking is pure read, zero LLM, zero network.
   Skip for brainstorming or scratch text — it is for load-bearing
   claims only.

12. CHECK KNOWLEDGE PROMOTION READINESS
   Before proposing that a knowledge drawer should be promoted or treated as
   canonical, call mempal_knowledge_policy to inspect the current Stage-1
   thresholds, then call mempal_knowledge_gate with the drawer_id. The policy
   and gate tools are read-only checks over deterministic evidence-ref rules.
   dao_tian -> canonical requires a human reviewer in Stage 1; evaluator-only
   canonization is not allowed. If allowed=false, use the reasons to gather
   more evidence or keep the drawer at its current lifecycle status. A passing
   gate is advisory; it does not auto-promote.

13. DISTILL KNOWLEDGE FROM EVIDENCE
   When repeated evidence suggests a reusable rule, call
   mempal_knowledge_distill to create candidate knowledge from evidence
   drawer refs. Distill is not summarization magic: provide the statement,
   content, tier, and evidence refs explicitly. The tool only creates
   candidate dao_ren or qi knowledge and never promotes it automatically.

14. MUTATE KNOWLEDGE LIFECYCLE WITH EVIDENCE
   Use mempal_knowledge_promote only after you have evidence refs that satisfy
   the promotion gate. MCP promotion is gate-enforced: the tool appends the
   supplied verification refs to the effective drawer, runs the deterministic
   gate, and mutates status only if allowed=true. Use mempal_knowledge_demote
   when counterexample evidence shows promoted knowledge is contradicted,
   obsolete, superseded, out of scope, or unsafe.

15. PUBLISH KNOWLEDGE OUTWARD ACROSS ANCHORS
   Anchor publication is separate from tier/status promotion. Use
   mempal_knowledge_publish_anchor only for active knowledge that should move
   outward in persistence scope: worktree -> repo or repo -> global. The tool
   updates only anchor metadata and audit history; it does not rewrite content,
   re-embed vectors, or change knowledge tier/status.

16. INSPECT AND GOVERN PHASE-2 KNOWLEDGE CARDS
   Use mempal_knowledge_cards to inspect Phase-2 knowledge card records and
   append-only event history. It also supports linked-evidence retrieval of
   active cards and governed card lifecycle actions: gate is read-only, promote
   requires verification evidence and a passing gate, and demote requires
   counterexample evidence. It does not create cards, replace mempal_search,
   assemble default context, or backfill drawers.

TOOLS:
  mempal_status        — current state + this protocol + AAAK format spec
  mempal_search        — semantic search with wing/room filters, citation-bearing
  mempal_context       — ordered mind-model runtime context (dao_tian -> dao_ren -> shu -> qi; evidence/cards opt-in)
  mempal_field_taxonomy — read-only recommended mind-model field values
  mempal_knowledge_distill — create candidate knowledge from evidence refs
  mempal_knowledge_policy — read-only Stage-1 promotion policy thresholds
  mempal_knowledge_gate — read-only knowledge promotion readiness check
  mempal_knowledge_cards — Phase-2 knowledge card list/get/retrieve/events/gate/promote/demote
  mempal_knowledge_promote — gate-enforced knowledge lifecycle promotion
  mempal_knowledge_demote — evidence-backed knowledge demotion or retirement
  mempal_knowledge_publish_anchor — metadata-only outward anchor publication
  mempal_ingest        — save a new drawer (wing required, room optional, importance 0-5)
  mempal_delete        — soft-delete a drawer by ID
  mempal_taxonomy      — list or edit routing keywords
  mempal_kg            — knowledge graph: add/query/invalidate/timeline/stats triples
  mempal_tunnels       — discover cross-wing room links
  mempal_peek_partner  — read partner agent's live session (Claude ↔ Codex), pure read
  mempal_cowork_push   — send a short handoff message to partner agent (P8)
  mempal_fact_check    — offline contradiction detection vs KG triples + entities (P9)
