# MIND MODEL DESIGN

**Date**: 2026-04-21
**Status**: P42 baseline implemented - future work remains explicit
**Scope**: Capture the mind-model decisions discussed in this conversation and map them to a practical system design.

## Implementation Checkpoint

P42 baseline means the core mind-model architecture is implemented enough to
operate as a governed memory system:

- Stage 1 typed drawers separate raw evidence from governed knowledge.
- `dao_tian -> dao_ren -> shu -> qi` runtime context assembly exists through
  `mempal context` and `mempal_context`.
- Stage 1 knowledge supports distill, gate, promote, demote, and outward anchor
  publication through CLI and MCP surfaces.
- Phase-2 `knowledge_cards`, `knowledge_evidence_links`, and
  `knowledge_events` exist in the same SQLite `palace.db`.
- Stage-1 knowledge drawers can be backfilled into Phase-2 cards through an
  explicit dry-run-first apply command.
- Phase-2 cards now have governed gate, promote, and demote lifecycle surfaces
  in CLI and MCP.

P42 baseline is not a claim that every future runtime integration is complete.
It marks the point where the design is no longer only a discussion capture: the
main storage, governance, and lifecycle surfaces exist and are test-backed.

## One-Sentence Thesis

The system should treat memory as a governed knowledge evolution layer where raw evidence is accumulated first, abstract knowledge is distilled second, and high-level `dao` is woken up before `shu` and `qi` at runtime.

## Goal

This design defines how to combine:

- memory
- skills
- external research tools
- runtime evaluation and promotion gates

into a coherent agent cognition system instead of treating them as unrelated parts.

The key idea is:

- memory is not just storage
- skills are not just static instructions
- research tools are not just retrieval utilities

Together they should form a disciplined loop:

1. gather evidence
2. distill candidate knowledge
3. promote only with sufficient evidence
4. demote when contradicted or obsolete

## Core Vocabulary

### Dao / Shu / Qi

This design adopts the following knowledge hierarchy:

- `dao`: high-level knowledge and governing principles
- `shu`: reusable methods, workflows, and procedural know-how
- `qi`: concrete tools, commands, interfaces, and tool-specific usage knowledge

`dao` itself has two levels:

- `dao_tian`: universal law; the most stable, cross-domain, objective knowledge
- `dao_ren`: domain law; stable patterns within a given field

Relationship:

- `dao_tian` shapes how the agent understands reality
- `dao_ren` shapes how the agent understands a specific field
- `shu` shapes how the agent acts
- `qi` shapes what the agent uses to act

### Memory Domains

These are independent from `dao / shu / qi`.

Memory domains answer: "who is this memory for?"

- `project`
- `agent`
- `skill`
- `global`

### Provenance

Every memory item should also record where it came from:

- `runtime`
- `research`
- `human`

## Crucial Orthogonality

`dao / shu / qi` is **not** the same axis as project memory, agent memory, or skill memory.

These are orthogonal coordinate systems:

1. `memory domain`
2. `knowledge tier`
3. `field`
4. `provenance`
5. `anchor`

Example:

- a debugging checklist may be `domain=skill`, `tier=shu`, `field=software-engineering`
- a model-specific CLI behavior note may be `domain=agent`, `tier=qi`, `field=tooling`
- a high-level principle like "evidence precedes assertion" may be `domain=global`, `tier=dao_tian`, `field=epistemics`

This orthogonality is required to avoid confusing:

- local project lessons with universal law
- temporary tool behavior with stable domain knowledge
- workflow tips with governing principles

## Anchor Model

Project identity should not be overloaded onto `wing`.

`wing` remains a semantic partitioning axis. It answers:

- what semantic area does this memory belong to?

It should not also answer:

- which checkout does this memory belong to?
- which branch experiment does this memory belong to?

That requires a separate anchor axis.

### Anchor Kinds

The recommended anchor model is:

- `global`
- `repo`
- `worktree`

Meaning:

- `global`: not tied to a repository checkout; used for cross-project memory, especially high-level `dao`
- `repo`: shared memory for the logical repository across branches and worktrees
- `worktree`: branch-local or experiment-local memory bound to one checkout path

### Why Worktree Must Exist

A repo-only project anchor is insufficient.

If memory is anchored only to the repo root:

- branch experiments contaminate each other
- temporary workflows and conclusions leak across unrelated checkouts
- failed experiments in one worktree pollute stable reasoning in another

Using the worktree path as a memory anchor preserves checkout-local memory.

### Why Worktree Alone Is Not Enough

A worktree-only anchor is also insufficient.

If memory is anchored only to worktree path:

- stable project knowledge fragments across checkouts
- verified project-wide `shu` and `dao_ren` become hard to share
- each new worktree starts too empty

Therefore the recommended model is dual-anchor, not worktree-only.

### Recommended Dual-Anchor Design

Every project-tied memory should be able to attach to:

- a `repo_anchor`
- optionally a `worktree_anchor`

This yields a useful separation:

- stable shared project memory lives at `repo`
- branch-local experiments, transient failures, and temporary heuristics live at `worktree`
- universal knowledge lives at `global`

### Anchor Does Not Replace Domain

Anchor and domain answer different questions.

- `domain` asks: who is this memory for?
- `anchor` asks: which persistence scope does it belong to?

Examples:

- a global epistemic law may be `domain=global`, `anchor=global`
- a project-wide build rule may be `domain=project`, `anchor=repo`
- a branch-local debugging lesson may be `domain=project`, `anchor=worktree`

### Stage-1 Anchor Fields

For the bootstrap drawer model, the minimum anchor fields should be:

- `anchor_kind`: `global | repo | worktree`
- `anchor_id`: normalized identifier for that anchor
- optional `parent_anchor_id`

The parent relationship is primarily for:

- `worktree -> repo`

This allows branch-local memory to inherit a stable project parent.

### Anchor Generation Rules

At stage 1, the anchor rules should be deterministic and filesystem-derived.

Recommended generation:

- `global`
  - fixed symbolic id, not derived from cwd
- `repo`
  - normalized repository identity
- `worktree`
  - normalized checkout identity

The critical rule is:

- do not derive anchor identity from `wing`

### Repo Anchor

The `repo_anchor` should identify the logical repository shared by all worktrees.

Recommended source:

- repository top-level path or a canonical repo identity derived from git metadata

The exact encoding can evolve, but the semantics should remain:

- all worktrees of the same repo map to the same `repo_anchor`

### Worktree Anchor

The `worktree_anchor` should identify a specific checkout path.

Recommended source:

- canonical worktree path

Semantics:

- different worktree paths produce different `worktree_anchor`s
- the main checkout and each extra git worktree are treated as separate worktree anchors

### Default Assignment Policy

At stage 1, memories should default to the following anchors:

- `dao_tian`
  - `global`
- stable `dao_ren`
  - usually `global` or `repo`, depending on whether it is cross-project or repo-specific
- project-shared `shu`
  - `repo`
- branch-local `qi` and experimental `shu`
  - `worktree`
- runtime observations from the current checkout
  - `worktree`
- external research evidence intended to support the current repo
  - `repo` by default, `worktree` when clearly branch-local

### Runtime Wake-Up with Anchors

When anchors are present, runtime assembly should prefer:

1. current `worktree`
2. current `repo`
3. `global`

This gives the agent:

- local experimental context first
- stable project memory second
- universal law last, but still available

This ordering complements the knowledge-tier wake-up order rather than replacing it.

In other words, anchor filtering and `dao / shu / qi` ordering are separate passes.

### Anchor Promotion Is Separate from Tier Promotion

The system needs two distinct upward movements:

1. knowledge-tier promotion
2. anchor-scope publication

These are not the same operation.

Examples:

- `qi @ worktree -> shu @ worktree` is a tier promotion
- `shu @ worktree -> shu @ repo` is an anchor publication

Recommended publication chain:

- `worktree -> repo -> global`

Meaning:

- new or experimental memory should usually start at `worktree`
- only verified, shareable project memory should move to `repo`
- only cross-project law should live at `global`

This yields the governing principle:

- write local first
- publish outward only after evidence justifies it

At stage 1, this can remain a disciplined workflow and data-model invariant even
if a full `publish_anchor` API does not exist yet.

## What Counts as Real Learning

The system should not consider "more stored text" to be the same as learning.

True learning happens only when:

1. observations accumulate in evidence memory
2. patterns are distilled into `qi` or `shu`
3. repeated and bounded patterns are promoted into `dao_ren`
4. only extremely stable, cross-domain knowledge is promoted into `dao_tian`

Therefore:

- `qi` can be accumulated quickly
- `shu` should be distilled with care
- `dao_ren` should be promoted rarely
- `dao_tian` should be promoted extremely rarely

## Layered Architecture

The system should be separated into four logical layers:

1. external tools
2. evidence memory
3. knowledge memory
4. runtime execution

### External Tools

Examples:

- `research-rs`
- CLI tools
- MCP tools
- test runners
- build tools

These belong to `qi`. They are capabilities, not high-level knowledge.

### Evidence Memory

This layer stores raw, source-backed observations.

Examples:

- research results
- runtime observations
- human explicit teachings
- concrete failures
- counterexamples
- contradictions

Evidence memory is allowed to contain inconsistent or conflicting facts.

That is expected. It reflects the world as observed.

### Knowledge Memory

This layer stores distilled, governed knowledge:

- `qi`
- `shu`
- `dao_ren`
- `dao_tian`

Knowledge memory should never be a raw dump of evidence. It is a controlled compilation layer built on top of evidence.

### Runtime Execution

This is where agents:

- wake up relevant knowledge
- choose the right skill
- bind to available tools
- act under constraints

## Evidence Memory vs Knowledge Memory

This split is mandatory.

If raw evidence and abstract knowledge are stored as the same thing forever, the system will quickly lose the distinction between:

- fact and conclusion
- observation and law
- candidate and canon

### Evidence Memory Principles

- raw-first
- source-backed
- append-friendly
- contradiction-tolerant
- high volume

### Knowledge Memory Principles

- distilled
- bounded
- stateful
- auditable
- lower volume

In short:

- evidence memory stores "what we saw"
- knowledge memory stores "what we therefore believe"

## Relationship Between Memory, Skills, and Research

### Memory

Memory is the governed persistence and wake-up system.

It should contain both:

- evidence memory
- knowledge memory

`dao` belongs here, not in external research tools.

### Skills

Skills primarily encode `shu`.

But a good skill should also expose the `dao` that justifies the workflow and the `qi` needed to execute it.

So a mature skill should be read as:

1. governing principle
2. workflow
3. tool binding

### Research Tools

External research tools do not define `dao`.

Their role is:

- fetch evidence
- structure evidence
- help verify or falsify existing knowledge

So `research-rs` is `qi`, and its output primarily feeds evidence memory.

## research-rs Boundary

`research-rs` is an external tool. It should not be given responsibility for maintaining `dao`.

Its appropriate role is close to the `LLM Wiki` pattern:

- raw sources
- wiki
- schema
- index
- log
- lint

But the outputs of `research-rs` should be treated as:

- evidence
- structured summaries
- candidate insights
- contradiction signals

They are not automatically `dao`.

Therefore:

- `research-rs` organizes the external world
- memory governs what is promoted from those results

P49 defines the research-rs ingestion path:

- raw/source research output enters as `memory_kind=evidence` with `provenance=research`
- structured summaries from research remain evidence unless explicitly distilled
- candidate knowledge only through distill from existing evidence refs
- contradiction signals become evidence or counterexamples for later demotion or
  gate evaluation

research must not directly create dao_tian. Research must not directly create
canonical or promoted knowledge. It must not bypass lifecycle gates. The highest
trust level research can supply by itself is source-backed evidence; memory owns
distillation, promotion, demotion, and canonicalization.

## Runtime Wake-Up Order

The runtime order should be explicit, not left to ad hoc semantic retrieval.

Recommended order:

1. `dao_tian`
2. `dao_ren`
3. `shu`
4. `qi`
5. `evidence`

Rationale:

- `dao_tian` calibrates the agent's worldview
- `dao_ren` calibrates the current field
- `shu` proposes methods
- `qi` binds execution to available tools
- `evidence` is used for grounding, exception handling, and proof

This order should not imply that the system always injects all layers.

Rather:

- use `dao_tian` sparingly and only when truly needed
- use `dao_ren` based on the active field
- use `shu` as the main skill trigger and execution layer
- use `qi` only when binding to concrete capabilities
- use evidence when verification or exception-handling is necessary

## Promotion Hierarchy

Knowledge should evolve through controlled promotion, not direct assertion.

Recommended conceptual path:

- `observation -> qi/shu`
- `shu -> dao_ren`
- `dao_ren -> dao_tian`

With the following meaning:

- `qi`: tool-bound knowledge
- `shu`: repeatable method
- `dao_ren`: domain law
- `dao_tian`: universal law

Higher promotion requires:

- fewer entries
- stronger evidence
- broader validity
- clearer boundaries
- stronger review

## Promotion Gate Philosophy

The system should never let "the agent found something interesting" equal "the system learned a law".

Instead:

- research and runtime can produce evidence quickly
- candidate knowledge can be distilled frequently
- promotion must be gated
- high-level law must be rare

This design strongly favors:

- fast evidence growth
- slow law growth

## Knowledge Lifecycle

The knowledge layer should support at least these states:

- `candidate`
- `promoted`
- `canonical`
- `demoted`
- `retired`

Meaning:

- `candidate`: not yet trusted for default runtime wake-up
- `promoted`: trusted enough for ordinary use
- `canonical`: highly stable and preferred
- `demoted`: weakened by stronger evidence or invalidation
- `retired`: no longer active, retained only for audit and history

Important rule:

High-level knowledge must be reversible. Promotion without demotion leads to knowledge pollution.

## Four Core Operations

The smallest viable lifecycle should be modeled through four operations:

1. `record`
2. `distill`
3. `promote`
4. `demote`

### record

Store raw evidence.

Examples:

- research result
- runtime failure
- human teaching
- observed contradiction

### distill

Create a candidate knowledge item from evidence.

Examples:

- tool usage note
- workflow heuristic
- domain pattern candidate

### promote

Move candidate knowledge into active runtime use once its gate is satisfied.

### demote

Reduce or retire knowledge when it is contradicted, superseded, or becomes outdated.

## Minimal Data Shape

### Evidence Memory

Evidence entries should be raw-first and source-backed.

Suggested fields:

- `id`
- `content`
- `domain`
- `field`
- `provenance`
- `source_ref`
- `timestamp`
- `tags`

### Knowledge Memory

Knowledge entries should be explicit and auditable.

Suggested fields:

- `id`
- `statement`
- `tier`
- `domain`
- `field`
- `status`
- `stability`
- `evidence_refs`
- `scope_constraints`
- `counterexamples`
- `promotion_history`

## Stage-1 Bootstrap Drawer Schema

Phase 1 should reuse the existing drawer system, but not by pretending all
drawers mean the same thing.

The bootstrap model should explicitly separate:

- `evidence drawer`
- `knowledge drawer`

### Shared Stage-1 Fields

Both drawer kinds should share the current base drawer fields and add:

- `memory_kind`: `evidence | knowledge`
- `domain`: `project | agent | skill | global`
- `field`
- `anchor_kind`: `global | repo | worktree`
- `anchor_id`
- optional `parent_anchor_id`

These fields should be explicit, not hidden inside JSON blobs, because they are
part of query-time filtering and runtime wake-up assembly.

### Evidence Drawer

The minimum stage-1 evidence drawer should add:

- `memory_kind='evidence'`
- `domain`
- `field`
- `provenance`: `runtime | research | human`
- `anchor_kind`
- `anchor_id`

Evidence drawers should *not* carry knowledge-governance fields such as:

- `tier`
- `status`
- `statement`
- `trigger_hints`
- role-separated knowledge refs

Evidence drawers record what was seen, taught, verified, or contradicted. They
can use tags to indicate whether they are supporting evidence, a boundary case,
or a counterexample, but they are not themselves promoted knowledge.

### Knowledge Drawer

The minimum stage-1 knowledge drawer should add:

- `memory_kind='knowledge'`
- `domain`
- `field`
- `statement`
- `tier`: `qi | shu | dao_ren | dao_tian`
- `status`: `candidate | promoted | canonical | demoted | retired`
- `supporting_refs`
- `counterexample_refs`
- `teaching_refs`
- `verification_refs`
- `scope_constraints`
- `trigger_hints`
- `anchor_kind`
- `anchor_id`
- optional `parent_anchor_id`

For knowledge drawers:

- `content` is the longer explanatory body
- `statement` is the short wake-up form

### Why Evidence Refs Must Be Role-Separated

Stage 1 should not collapse all evidence into one undifferentiated
`evidence_refs` list.

The minimum useful split is:

- `supporting_refs`
- `counterexample_refs`
- `teaching_refs`
- `verification_refs`

This matters because the runtime and future evaluator must be able to
distinguish:

- what supports a knowledge claim
- what limits it
- what was explicitly taught by a human
- what was actively re-verified rather than merely observed

### Minimal Trigger Hints

Stage 1 should allow a very small `trigger_hints` object for knowledge drawers,
but it must remain a bias layer, not a second skill registry.

The allowed structure should be limited to:

- `intent_tags`
- `workflow_bias`
- `tool_needs`

It should not directly name hard skill ids or become the authoritative trigger
mechanism.

### Statement vs Content

`statement` and `content` should have different jobs.

Recommended rule:

- `statement` is the short, directly wakeable knowledge proposition
- `content` is the explanatory body with rationale, boundaries, and clarifying detail

Therefore:

- `statement` should not contain extended justification, examples, or long scope notes
- `content` should not merely restate `statement`

This supports a clean runtime pattern:

1. wake by `statement`
2. drill into `content` only when explanation, review, or adjudication is needed

### Natural Status Distribution by Tier

The stage-1 model should expect different status distributions for each tier:

- `dao_tian`: usually `canonical` or `demoted`
- `dao_ren`: usually `candidate` or `promoted`
- `shu`: usually `promoted`
- `qi`: usually `candidate` or `promoted`

This is not merely stylistic. It reflects the intended rarity and stability of
each layer.

## Minimal Interface Surface

If exposed through memory APIs, the minimal operations should roughly map to:

- `record(content, domain, field, provenance, source_ref, tags?)`
- `distill(statement, tier_candidate, domain, field, evidence_refs, scope_constraints, rationale, counterexamples?)`
- `promote(knowledge_id, target_status, promotion_reason, validation_refs, reviewer)`
- `demote(knowledge_id, reason_type, reason, evidence_refs, target_status)`

Design principle:

The caller should not self-score high-level confidence directly. Confidence and stability should be system-derived or gate-derived whenever possible.

## Two-Phase Implementation Strategy

The recommended implementation path is two-stage.

### Phase 1: Drawer Bootstrap

Use two drawer types:

- `evidence drawer`
- `knowledge drawer`

Purpose:

- validate the value of the model quickly
- avoid a large rewrite
- reuse the current storage, ingest, and search paths

Limits:

- knowledge drawers will eventually become overloaded with lifecycle and governance metadata
- this is a bootstrap architecture, not the final form

Implemented Phase-1 runtime surface:

- `mempal context <query>` assembles a runtime context pack from typed drawers
- `mempal_context` exposes the same pack to MCP-connected agents
- knowledge sections are ordered as `dao_tian -> dao_ren -> shu -> qi`
- Stage-1 field taxonomy is guidance-only and read-only: `mempal field-taxonomy`
  and `mempal_field_taxonomy` expose recommended fields such as `general`,
  `epistemics`, `software-engineering`, `debugging`, `tooling`, `research`,
  `writing`, and `diary`, while custom field strings remain valid
- `dao_tian` is sparse by default in runtime context: `mempal context` and
  `mempal_context` inject at most 1 `dao_tian` item unless the caller explicitly
  sets `--dao-tian-limit` / `dao_tian_limit`; `0` disables `dao_tian`
- `wake-up` remains an L0/L1 memory refresh surface and does not assemble typed
  `dao_tian -> dao_ren -> shu -> qi` sections; typed operating guidance belongs
  to `mempal context` / `mempal_context`
- evidence remains opt-in via `--include-evidence`
- same-tier items prefer `worktree`, then current `repo`, then `repo://legacy`, then `global`
- `global` anchor candidates use `domain=global`, preserving the invariant that global anchors do not hold project-local domain memory
- `trigger_hints` are exposed as metadata only; they do not directly execute skills
- MCP protocol guidance consumes context in order: read `dao_tian` and `dao_ren` for judgment, use `shu` to bias workflow / skill choice, and use `qi` to bias concrete tool choice
- memory hints never override system, user, repo, or client-native skill rules
- bootstrap distill CLI creates candidate `dao_ren` / `qi` knowledge drawers from existing evidence refs without auto-promotion or LLM summarization
- `mempal_knowledge_distill` exposes the same deterministic distill operation to MCP-connected agents, letting runtime agents create candidate knowledge from evidence refs without shelling out
- bootstrap lifecycle CLI supports manual `promote` / `demote` on existing knowledge drawers by updating status plus verification / counterexample refs and writing audit entries
- lifecycle verification / counterexample refs are hardened to require existing evidence drawers, preserving the rule that promotion and demotion are justified by evidence rather than arbitrary ids or other knowledge claims
- promotion gate CLI provides a read-only advisory report before promotion, using deterministic evidence-count policy without mutating status, refs, vectors, schema, or audit history
- `mempal_knowledge_gate` exposes the same read-only promotion gate to MCP-connected agents, so runtime agents can check readiness without shelling out or mutating lifecycle state
- Stage-1 promotion policy is inspectable without a concrete drawer through `mempal knowledge policy` and `mempal_knowledge_policy`
- current Stage-1 thresholds are:
  - `dao_tian -> canonical`: 3 supporting refs, 2 verification refs, 1 teaching ref, human reviewer required, counterexamples block
  - `dao_ren -> promoted`: 2 supporting refs, 1 verification ref, counterexamples block
  - `shu -> promoted`: 1 supporting ref, 1 verification ref, counterexamples block
  - `qi -> promoted`: 1 supporting ref, 1 verification ref, counterexamples block
- `dao_tian -> canonical` always requires a human reviewer in Stage 1; evaluator-only canonization is intentionally out of scope
- `mempal_knowledge_promote` and `mempal_knowledge_demote` expose lifecycle mutation to MCP-connected agents; promotion is gate-enforced after appending supplied verification refs, while demotion requires counterexample evidence
- `mempal knowledge publish-anchor` implements explicit outward anchor publication for active knowledge (`worktree -> repo -> global`) as a metadata-only operation separate from tier/status promotion
- `mempal_knowledge_publish_anchor` exposes the same outward anchor publication operation to MCP-connected agents without changing content, vectors, tier, or status
- lifecycle updates are metadata-only in Stage 1; they do not rewrite content, re-embed vectors, or create Phase-2 knowledge cards

### Phase 2: Knowledge Card Extraction

Once the model proves useful, separate knowledge memory from evidence memory structurally.

Recommended objects:

- `drawers` for evidence
- `knowledge_cards`
- `knowledge_evidence_links`
- `knowledge_events`

Minimum schema v8 draft:

`knowledge_cards`:

- `id TEXT PRIMARY KEY`
- `statement TEXT NOT NULL`
- `content TEXT NOT NULL`
- `tier TEXT NOT NULL CHECK ('qi','shu','dao_ren','dao_tian')`
- `status TEXT NOT NULL CHECK ('candidate','promoted','canonical','demoted','retired')`
- `domain TEXT NOT NULL CHECK ('project','agent','skill','global')`
- `field TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'general'`
- `anchor_kind TEXT NOT NULL CHECK ('global','repo','worktree')`
- `anchor_id TEXT NOT NULL`
- `parent_anchor_id TEXT`
- `scope_constraints TEXT`
- `trigger_hints TEXT`
- `created_at TEXT NOT NULL`
- `updated_at TEXT NOT NULL`

`knowledge_evidence_links`:

- `id TEXT PRIMARY KEY`
- `card_id TEXT NOT NULL`
- `evidence_drawer_id TEXT NOT NULL`
- `role TEXT NOT NULL CHECK ('supporting','verification','counterexample','teaching')`
- `note TEXT`
- `created_at TEXT NOT NULL`
- unique key: `(card_id, evidence_drawer_id, role)`

`knowledge_events`:

- `id TEXT PRIMARY KEY`
- `card_id TEXT NOT NULL`
- `event_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK ('created','promoted','demoted','retired','linked','unlinked','updated','published_anchor')`
- `from_status TEXT`
- `to_status TEXT`
- `reason TEXT NOT NULL`
- `actor TEXT`
- `metadata TEXT`
- `created_at TEXT NOT NULL`

Minimum indexes:

- `knowledge_cards(tier, status)`
- `knowledge_cards(domain, field)`
- `knowledge_cards(anchor_kind, anchor_id)`
- `knowledge_evidence_links(card_id)`
- `knowledge_evidence_links(evidence_drawer_id)`
- `knowledge_events(card_id, created_at)`

This yields a cleaner separation:

- evidence says what happened
- knowledge says what is believed
- events say how that belief evolved

Storage decision:

- Phase-2 `knowledge_cards` should live in the same SQLite `palace.db`
- they should be separate tables from `drawers`, not overloaded drawer rows
- `drawers` remain the raw evidence and citation root
- `knowledge_evidence_links` should reference evidence drawers by `drawer_id`
- `knowledge_events` should be transactional with knowledge-card lifecycle
  changes and evidence-link mutations
- a separate persistence layer is out of scope unless future measured needs
  prove the single-file SQLite boundary insufficient

Rationale:

- mempal's product invariant is a local single-binary, single-file memory palace
- knowledge promotion/demotion must stay transactionally tied to evidence refs
- citations remain simpler and safer when evidence drawer ids are the durable root
- using a second database or service would add operational complexity before the
  Phase-2 model has proven it needs independent scaling

Implemented Phase-2 surface at P42 baseline:

- `knowledge_cards`, `knowledge_evidence_links`, and `knowledge_events` are
  schema v8 tables in `palace.db`
- Rust core APIs can create/read/update/list cards, link evidence, and append
  events
- `mempal knowledge-card` exposes create/get/list/link/event/events
- `mempal_knowledge_cards` exposes list/get/events to MCP-connected agents
- `mempal knowledge-card backfill-plan` reports Stage-1 knowledge drawers that
  are ready to become cards without writing
- `mempal knowledge-card backfill-apply` defaults to dry-run and only writes
  cards, links, and created events with `--execute`
- `mempal knowledge-card gate` evaluates card readiness from role-separated
  evidence links
- `mempal knowledge-card promote` and `mempal knowledge-card demote` mutate
  card status transactionally with role-specific evidence links and append-only
  events
- `mempal_knowledge_cards` also exposes `gate`, `promote`, and `demote` actions
  over the same core lifecycle logic

Phase-2 cards are governed objects, but they are not yet the default
context/search source. At P42, `mempal context`, `mempal_context`, and
`mempal_search` remains drawer/citation based. Cards now have an explicit
linked-evidence retrieval path, but they are still not returned by default
search.

### Phase-2 Card Retrieval Contract

P43 defines the contract for future card-aware runtime consumption without
implementing retrieval behavior yet.

A card retrieval item is a governed knowledge result, not a raw drawer result.
The minimum returned card fields are: `card_id`, `statement`, `content`, `tier`,
`status`, `domain`, `field`, `anchor_kind`, and `anchor_id`.

Each card retrieval item must expose role-separated evidence citations derived
from `knowledge_evidence_links`. The minimum evidence citation fields are:
`evidence_drawer_id`, `role`, and `source_file`.

Default runtime eligibility is status-gated:

- `promoted` and `canonical` cards are runtime-eligible by default
- `candidate`, `demoted`, and `retired` cards are excluded by default

This preserves the governance boundary:

- card records carry distilled belief
- linked evidence drawers remain the citation root
- inactive card states remain inspectable but are not injected into ordinary
  runtime context

P43 does not change `mempal context` or `mempal_context` behavior.
P43 does not change `mempal_search` behavior.
Card embeddings, ranking strategy, and card-aware context/search surfaces are
deferred to later specs.

P44 adds the first explicit card-aware context surface:

- `mempal context --include-cards`
- `mempal_context` with `include_cards=true`

This remains opt-in. Default context assembly is still drawer-only. When enabled,
active Phase-2 cards are appended inside the existing
`dao_tian -> dao_ren -> shu -> qi` sections and expose `card_id` plus
role-separated `evidence_citations`. Each citation keeps the evidence drawer as
the citation root through `evidence_drawer_id`, `role`, and `source_file`.

P44 does not change `mempal_search`, does not add card embeddings, and does not
make cards the default runtime source.

P45 chooses the first card retrieval strategy:

- `mempal knowledge-card retrieve <query>`
- `mempal_knowledge_cards` with `action="retrieve"`

The strategy is linked-evidence-first. It searches evidence drawers through the
existing BM25+vector drawer search path, follows `knowledge_evidence_links`, and
returns active cards linked to matched evidence. Returned card items include the
card record, a score derived from matched evidence, and role-separated evidence
citations with `evidence_drawer_id`, `role`, `source_file`, and score.

P45 intentionally does not add card embeddings, does not add card vector
storage, and does not make `mempal_search` return cards.

P46 keeps card-aware context opt-in. The default context remains drawer-only for
both `mempal context` and `mempal_context`; operators must still pass
`--include-cards` or `include_cards=true` to inject Phase-2 cards into the
typed context pack.

This is a deliberate default policy, not an unfinished implementation gap.
Cards are now retrievable and context-injectable, but default runtime context is
a high-trust path. It should not silently switch from drawer-backed active
knowledge to mixed drawer/card guidance until real runtime evidence shows the
change improves agent behavior without weakening citations.

Evidence required before default enablement:

- repeated runtime traces where card-aware context causes better skill/tool
  selection than drawer-only context
- no observed citation loss: every default card item must preserve linked
  evidence citations as the citation root
- no material context bloat: card items must not crowd out higher-priority
  `dao_tian`, `dao_ren`, `shu`, or `qi` guidance
- no lifecycle confusion: inactive cards must remain excluded and demoted cards
  must not re-enter default context through linked evidence
- explicit rollback criteria: a future default-on spec must define how to return
  to drawer-only defaults if card injection degrades runtime behavior

P47 keeps card-level embeddings deferred. P45 linked-evidence retrieval remains
the only implemented card retrieval strategy: cards are found through matched
evidence drawers, not through a separate card vector index.

This keeps the citation model simple. Card statements are distilled beliefs;
evidence drawers remain the source-backed material. A card embedding index would
make card statements directly retrievable, which may improve recall, but it also
adds a new stale-vector surface and can make unsupported belief text feel like a
primary source unless every result still carries linked evidence citations.

Evidence required before card embeddings:

- statement-match misses: repeated retrieval traces where linked-evidence search
  misses useful active cards because evidence wording does not match the query
  but the card statement does
- citation preservation: card-embedding results must still return linked
  evidence citations as the citation root
- measurable recall improvement over P45 linked-evidence retrieval without
  unacceptable precision loss
- schema and maintenance plan for card vector storage, reindexing, and
  stale-vector handling
- rollback behavior that can disable card-vector retrieval and fall back to P45
  linked-evidence retrieval without data loss

P48 keeps `knowledge_events` as the authoritative Phase-2 card audit trail, with
no default JSONL dual-write for card lifecycle mutations. This keeps card
promote/demote/backfill behavior transactionally bound to the same SQLite
database that owns `knowledge_cards` and `knowledge_evidence_links`.

Stage-1 drawer lifecycle continues to use `audit.jsonl` where already defined.
Phase-2 card lifecycle does not mirror those entries into `audit.jsonl` by
default because that would create two audit surfaces with different durability
and transaction semantics. The append-only `knowledge_events` table is the
source of truth for card lifecycle history.

If an external integration needs JSONL card history, it should be added as an
explicit export surface. JSONL export must be derived from `knowledge_events`,
must be reproducible, and must not become a second source of truth.

## Decision on Bootstrap vs Final Architecture

Current recommendation:

- start with two drawer types
- explicitly mark this as bootstrap-only
- plan for extraction into separate knowledge objects later

This gives the system a low-cost learning path without pretending the temporary structure is ideal.

## What Belongs Where

### In research-rs

- ingest and normalize external sources
- maintain research wiki/index/log/lint
- emit structured evidence and candidate insights

### In memory layer

- store evidence memory
- store knowledge memory
- maintain `dao / shu / qi`
- manage promotion and demotion lifecycle

### In skills

- encode reusable workflows
- expose relevant `dao`
- bind to `qi`

### In evaluator/gate

- validate promotions
- handle demotions
- guard against self-pollution

## Non-Goals

This design does not assume:

- fully automatic promotion to `dao`
- external research directly creating universal law
- replacing raw evidence with compressed knowledge
- collapsing evidence, knowledge, and workflow into one storage object forever

## Current Recommendation

Proceed with the following assumptions unless future evidence rejects them:

- `dao` belongs to the memory layer
- `research-rs` is an external `qi` tool, not a `dao` container
- evidence memory and knowledge memory should be explicitly separated
- runtime typed context should assemble `dao` before `shu`, and `shu` before
  `qi`; wake-up remains a refresh surface, not the typed assembler
- the implementation should begin with drawer bootstrap and evolve into a
  dedicated knowledge model inside the same SQLite `palace.db`

## Future Work After P42

P42 originally left one explicit follow-up:

- add evaluator-assisted promotion only behind deterministic gates and human
  review rules for high-level knowledge

P50 closes that item as policy. P50 defines evaluator-assisted promotion as advisory-only.
Evaluators are not lifecycle actors.

Evaluators may:

- recommend promotion or demotion candidates
- propose supporting, verification, teaching, and counterexample evidence refs
- produce contradiction candidates and risk notes
- explain why a knowledge item appears ready or unsafe

Evaluators must not directly mutate status or otherwise act as lifecycle writers:

- append lifecycle refs as authoritative gate input
- bypass deterministic promotion or demotion gates
- satisfy reviewer requirements by evaluator-only review
- create automatic promotion or demotion paths

The deterministic gates remain authoritative. Promotion and demotion still go
through the existing gate-enforced CLI/MCP lifecycle surfaces. `dao_tian`
canonicalization still requires a human reviewer; evaluator-only canonization is forbidden.
If a future implementation adds evaluator APIs, that work must be a separate
spec and preserve deterministic replay, evidence citation, and audit semantics.

No open Future Work remains in the P42 list.

## Completion Status After P50

P51 closure audit: the MIND-MODEL baseline is complete.

No open implementation tasks remain in the P12-P50 baseline. The completed
baseline includes:

- typed evidence and knowledge drawers
- `dao_tian`, `dao_ren`, `shu`, and `qi` governance boundaries
- worktree/repo/global anchor behavior
- wake-up/context separation
- context-guided skill/tool selection
- distill, gate, promote, demote, and anchor publication lifecycle surfaces
- Phase-2 knowledge card storage, lifecycle, retrieval, and opt-in context
- research ingestion and evaluator promotion policies

Completion does not mean every optional future enhancement is implemented. It
means the current design baseline has no known open implementation task. Future
evaluator APIs, card-level embeddings, default card context, research adapters,
or other expansions must start as new-stage specs with their own evidence,
rollback criteria, and acceptance checks.

## Phase 3 Intake Roadmap

P52 Phase-3 intake roadmap defines how work starts after baseline closure.
Phase 3 is new-stage work, not unfinished P12-P50 baseline work.

Candidate tracks:

- evaluator APIs
- card retrieval maturity
- research adapter ingestion
- runtime adoption evidence

Intake rules:

- each candidate must state evidence, rollback criteria, and acceptance checks before implementation begins
- default-enabling card context or card embeddings requires measured retrieval benefit
- Evaluator APIs must preserve the P50 advisory-only lifecycle boundary
- Research adapters must preserve the P49 evidence-first ingestion boundary
- card retrieval changes must preserve citation and audit semantics
- runtime adoption work must include rollback criteria for agent behavior changes

The first Phase-3 implementation should be selected only after one candidate has
enough evidence to justify implementation. Until then, Phase 3 remains an intake
queue, not an implementation commitment.

## Closing Summary

The proposed system is not "RAG plus skills."

It is a governed cognition stack:

- external tools gather and organize evidence
- memory stores both evidence and distilled knowledge
- skills operationalize methods under governing principles
- evaluators control what is allowed to harden into lasting law

That is the intended meaning of this design:

- `dao` is memory-level high-order knowledge
- `shu` is operational method
- `qi` is executable capability
- evidence is the substrate from which all of them must be justified
